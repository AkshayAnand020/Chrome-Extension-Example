This is a free, open-source, sample application demonstrating use of the
Asana API. It takes the form of a Chrome Extension that, when installed,
integrates Asana into your web experience in the following ways:

  * Creates a button in your button-bar which, when clicked, pops up a
    QuickAdd window to create a new task associated with the current web page.
    It will populate the task name with the page title by default, and
    put the URL in the notes, along with any text you may have selected
    when you pressed the button.

  * Installs the special Asana TAB+Q keyboard shortcut. When this key combo
    is pressed from any web page, it brings up the same popup.

YOU MUST HAVE THE ASANA API ENABLED FOR YOUR ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO USE
THIS EXTENSION.

    This is not a real ORM, just the bare bones necessary to get a few
    simple things done.

    Source for the popup window, contains the top-level logic which drives
    most of the user-facing functionality.
